## Overview

The lifestyle you lead enriches your work and personal life, we decided to give our users a website which users can find out the latest fashion trends, best places to eat and shop, current talked about topics and what to read, watch and listen to. So we settled on a lifestyle magazine.

This was built with a full JavaScript stack which uses MongoDB (document database), Express (web server in Node), React.js (JavaScript library) and Node.js (runs Express).

It was my first MERN application and the first time working in a group of four. We were given a week to complete and this was one of my favourite projects to work on, as it all seems to flow seemingness. The team had brilliant chemistry and we were all in agreement with how we wanted to project to look and be built.

I worked on front end, focusing on the homepage, current section, responsiveness, error page and uniforming all the pages. I also designed the logo and set the general theme. If we had more time, I would have liked to have the ratings and signing out sections functioning properly.

## Technical Requirements

* Work in a team, using **git to code collaboratively**.
* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
* **Have automated tests** for _at least_ one RESTful resource on the back-end. Improve your employability by demonstrating a good understanding of testing principals.
​
## Necessary Deliverables

* A **working app** hosted on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project

    * An embedded screenshot of the app
    * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
